9. - [x] Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'. 
Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) *n. E.g.- <br/>
        <pre>
        4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
        3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 
        2! = 2 * 1 = 2 
     
     Also, 
        1! = 1 
        0! = 1
        </pre>
